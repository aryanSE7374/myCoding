# portfolio page of 2023

## Project description:
 In this challenge I was tasked to build a portfolio to use and add on to as I learn new topics. I used a tutorial to help me build a page I can be proud of. I have included the necessary : flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I got to practice and learn new skills in HTML and CSS along adding basic javascript to allow users to switch between different content sections.

## Installation
Open a new repository, create a folder with images for your project, watch https://youtu.be/0YFrGy_mzjY to create the portfolio template that meets the criteria of including; flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. Add appropriate links to show previous work.
## Usage
I will use this as my main portfolio for the rest of the class in order to land a job in the tech field. I will use it to practice and add to my portfolio.
